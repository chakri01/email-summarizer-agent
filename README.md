# Email Summarizer Agent

Welcome to the **Email Summarizer Agent** repository! This project is designed to automatically summarize emails using advanced natural language processing techniques. It helps you quickly digest long email threads and important messages by providing short, concise summaries.

## Features

- **Automated Summarization:** Uses state-of-the-art NLP techniques to generate summaries of email content.
- **Customizable Output:** Configure summary length and style based on your preferences.
- **Easy Integration:** Designed to be integrated easily into your existing workflows or email clients.
- **Command-line Interface:** Quickly summarize emails directly from your terminal.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Built to allow additional features and enhancements, such as sentiment analysis or keyword extraction.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chakri01/email-summarizer-agent.git
   cd email-summarizer-agent
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. Then install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment (if necessary):**

   If your setup requires API keys or specific environment configurations, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the required variables. An example of the `.env` file:

   ```env
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   MODEL=default-summarizer
   ```

## Usage

You can run the summarizer from the command line as follows:

```bash
python summarize.py --input path/to/email.txt --output summary.txt
```

- **--input:** Path to the text file containing the full email content.
- **--output:** Path where the generated summary will be saved.  
- Additional command-line options allow you to customize summary length and other parameters. Run `python summarize.py --help` for more details.
